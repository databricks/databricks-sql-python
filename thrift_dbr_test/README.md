# Thrift-dbr-test-classes

The classes defined in this folder depend on base classes defined in runtime.
(sql/hive-thriftserver/pythontesting/) They are to be combined in the test-docker-image, see e.g. //cmdexec/client/pysql\_v2-test-image.

These test suites are used for running existing tests that were originally created for ODBC on the python clients that live in universe.
