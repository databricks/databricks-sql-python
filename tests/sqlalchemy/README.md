# Introduction

This is work-in-progress of a SQLAlchemy dialect for Databricks.

The dialect is embedded within the Databricks SQL Connector.

## Test Usage

Initialize your project with Poetry (e.g., `poetry install`) before continuing with the sample tests here.

A `Makefile` has been setup to reduce typing.

Configure the test via environment using the sample `env.template`.

To sample run would be as follows:

```bash
$ source yourtestenv
$ make simpletest
```
